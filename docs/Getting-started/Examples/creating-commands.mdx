## Creating commands

:::::info
ℹ️ This page is about creating commands for your Discord bot. It requires you to have a valid [main file](/docs/getting-started/examples/main-file).
::::warning
⚠️ Please make sure to select below the command creation "step" you need. The section below is divided into "creating slash commands" and "creating message commands".
::::

:::::

## Before you continue

Assuming you've followed the guide so far, your project directory should look something like this:

```
discord-bot/
├── node_modules/
├── config.js/
├── index.js/
├── package-lock.json
└── package.json
```

Following this guide, create a `src/` folder and move `index.js` and `config.js` into the new `src/` folder.

Your new project directory should look something like this:

```
discord-bot/
├── node_modules/
├── src/
│   ├── config.js/
│   └── index.js/
├── package-lock.json
└── package.json
```

:::warning
⚠️ Please make sure to update your `package.json` file and edit the `"main": "index.js"` field to `"main": "src/index.js"`.

        ℹ️  For fully functional slash commands, there are three important pieces of code that need to be written. They are:

        1. The individual command files, containing their definitions and functionality.
        2. The [command handler], which dynamically reads the files and executes the commands.
        3. The [command deployment script], to register your slash commands with Discord so they appear in the interface.

        These steps can be done in any order, but all are required before the commands are fully functional.

        On this page, you'll complete Step 1. Make sure to also complete the other pages linked above!
        :::

        ## Individual command files (slash commands)

        Create a new folder inside the `src/` folder, named `commands` and a subfolder named `music` inside it, which is where you'll store all of your music command files. You'll be using the [`SlashCommandBuilder`](https://discord.js.org/docs/packages/builders/1.10.0/SlashCommandBuilder:Class) <i className="fa-solid fa-arrow-up-right-from-square" style={{ fontSize: '0.6em'}}/> class to construct the command definitions.

        At a minimum, the definition of a slash command must have a name and a description. Slash command names must be between 1-32 characters and contain no capital letters, spaces, or symbols other than `-` and `_`. Using the builder, a simple play command definition would look like this:
        
        ```javascript showLineNumbers
        new SlashCommandBuilder()
            .setName("play")
            .setDescription("Play a song/playlist.")
            .addStringOption((option) => option.setName("query").setDescription("The search query for the song/playlist").setRequired(true)),
        ```
        A slash command also requires a function to run when the command is used, to respond to the interaction. Using an interaction response method confirms to Discord that your bot successfully received the interaction, and has responded to the user. Discord enforces this to ensure that all slash commands provide a good user experience (UX). Failing to respond will cause Discord to show that the command failed, even if your bot is performing other actions as a result.

        The simplest way to acknowledge and respond to an interaction is the `interaction.reply()` method. Other methods of replying are covered on the [Response methods <i className="fa-solid fa-arrow-up-right-from-square" style={{ fontSize: '0.6em'}}/>](https://discordjs.guide/slash-commands/response-methods.html#ephemeral-responses) page later in this section.

        ```javascript showLineNumbers
        async execute(client, interaction) {
            await interaction.reply('Playing your song/playlist!')
        }
        ```

        Put these two together by creating a `play.js` file in the `src/commands/music` folder for your first command. Inside this file, you're going to define and export two items.


        - The `data` property, which will provide the command definition shown above for registering to Discord.
        - The `execute()` method, which will contain the functionality to run from our event handler when the command is used.

        These are placed inside `module.exports` so they can be read by other files; namely the command loader and command deployment scripts mentioned earlier.

            <TabItem value="slashcommands-1" label="src/commands/play.js" default>
                ```javascript showLineNumbers
                const { SlashCommandBuilder } = require('discord.js');

                module.exports = {
                    data: new SlashCommandBuilder()
                        .setName("play")
                        .setDescription("Play a song/playlist.")
                        .addStringOption((option) => option.setName("query").setDescription("The search query for the song/playlist").setRequired(true)),
                    async execute(client, interaction) {
                        await interaction.reply('Playing your song/playlist!')
                    }
                }
                ```
            </TabItem>

        ℹ️  [`module.exports`](https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_module_exports)<i className="fa-solid fa-arrow-up-right-from-square" style={{ fontSize: '0.6em'}}/> is how you export data in Node.js so that you can [`require()`](https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_require_id)<i className="fa-solid fa-arrow-up-right-from-square" style={{ fontSize: '0.6em'}}/> it in other files.

        That's it for your basic play command. Below is what your project directory should look like:

        ```
        discord-bot/
        ├── node_modules/
        ├── src/
        │   ├── commands/
        │   │   └── play.js
        │   ├── config.js/
        │   └── index.js/
        ├── package-lock.json
        └── package.json
        ```
