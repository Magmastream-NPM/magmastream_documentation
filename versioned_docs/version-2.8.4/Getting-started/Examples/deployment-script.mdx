## Registering commands

:::::tip
💡 For fully functional slash commands, you need three important pieces of code:

1. The [individual command](/docs/getting-started/examples/creating-commands) files, containing their definitions and functionality.
2. The [command handler](/docs/getting-started/examples/command-handling), which dynamically reads the files and executes the commands.
3. The command deployment script, to register your slash commands with Discord so they appear in the interface.

These steps can be done in any order, but **all are required** before the commands are fully functional.

This page details how to complete **Step 3**. Make sure to also complete the other pages linked above!
:::info
ℹ️ This section is **only** required, if you are using `slash-commands`!

## Before you continue

Assuming you've followed the guide so far, your project directory should look something like this:

```
discord-bot/
├── node_modules/
├── src/
│   ├── commands/
│   │   └── play.js
│   ├── events/
│   │   ├── discord/
│   │   │   ├── raw.js
│   │   │   ├── ready.js
│   │   │   └── interactionCreate.js
│   │   └── magmastream/
│   │       ├── nodeConnect.js
│   │       ├── trackStart.js
│   │       └── queueEnd.js
│   ├── config.js
│   └── index.js
├── package-lock.json
└── package.json
```

## Creating the deployment-script

Create a new file inside the `src/` folder named `deploy-commands.js`.

The `deploy-commands.js` file will be used to communicate with the Discord API, informing it about the commands we want to display when a user types `/` in the chat.

Below is an example of what the `deploy-commands.js` file might look like:
```javascript showLineNumbers
const config = require("./config.js");
const { REST } = require("@discordjs/rest");
const { Routes } = require("discord-api-types/v10");

module.exports = async (client) => {
	const rest = new REST().setToken(config.token);

	try {
		console.log(`[INFO] Started refreshing application commands.`);

		// Read all of the command files
		const data = [];
		client.commands.forEach((command) => {
			try {
				// Create a copy of the command data without the execute function
				let item = {
					name: command.data.name,
					description: command.data.description,
				};

				// If the command has options, add them to the item
				if (command.data.options) {
					item.options = command.data.options;
				}

				// Add the command to the data array
				data.push(item);
			} catch (error) {}
		});

		// Put the data array to the Discord API
		await rest.put(Routes.applicationCommands(client.user.id), { body: data });

		console.log(`[INFO] Successfully reloaded ${data.length} application commands.`);
	} catch (error) {
		// And of course, make sure you catch and log any errors!
		console.error(`[ERROR] Failed to reload application commands: ${error}`);
	}
};
```

## Deploying the commands
:::warning
⚠️ Don’t forget to update the `src/events/discord/ready.js` event file to deploy the commands once the bot has entered the "ready" state.
:::

```javascript ${9} showLineNumbers
const { Events } = require("discord.js");

module.exports = {
	name: Events.ClientReady,
	once: true,

	execute(client) {
		// Deploy slash commands
		require("../../deploy-commands")(client);

		// Initialize Lavalink
		client.manager.init(client.user.id);

		// Print a message to the console indicating that the client is ready
		console.log(`[INFO] Ready! Logged in as ${client.user.tag}`);
	},
};
```

## Final project structure
```
discord-bot/
├── node_modules/
├── src/
│   ├── commands/
│   │   └── play.js
│   ├── events/
│   │   ├── discord/
│   │   │   ├── raw.js
│   │   │   ├── ready.js
│   │   │   └── interactionCreate.js
│   │   └── magmastream/
│   │       ├── nodeConnect.js
│   │       ├── trackStart.js
│   │       └── queueEnd.js
│   ├── config.js
│   ├── index.js
│   └── deploy-commands.js
├── package-lock.json
└── package.json
```

With that, the "Quick Start" guide should be complete. Upon entering `node .` in your terminal, you should have a fully functional bot capable of playing songs, titles, URLs, or playlists, with all events handled in their respective files.
